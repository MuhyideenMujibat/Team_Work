					Nellobyte Systems Ltd. <br>

its conflict of law provisions. You and Nellobyte Systems Ltd. agree to submit to the
<br>
personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county <br>
of San Francisco, California. The failure of Nellobyte Systems Ltd. to exercise or
<br>
enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of <br>

the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as <br>
reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in <br>
full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to <br>
the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use <br>
of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such <br>
claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

					review<br>
<br>

<br>
right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
