	<h3 align="justify">No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</h3>
	<p style="margin-top:0in" align="justify">We and our users do not tolerate

	communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to

	Please&nbsp; 
	report related spam or spoof emails to us. You may not use our 
	communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would 
	violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter 
	messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious 
	activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store 
	messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address 
	that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), 
	we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any 
	marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. </p>
	<h3 align="justify">Account Protection </h3>
	<p style="margin-top:0in" align="justify">Your password is the key to your

	disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your 
	password or your personal information with others, remember that you are 
	responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose 
	control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your 
	personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on 
	your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any 
	reason, you should immediately notify us and change your 
	password. </p>
	<h3 align="justify">Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal 
	Information </h3>
	<p style="margin-top:0in" align="justify">You can see, review and change 
	most of your personal information by signing on to your account. 
	Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it 
	is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update 
	your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a 
	public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your 
	request, we will close your account and remove your personal information 
	from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and 
	in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from 
	closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, 
	resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, 
	enforce our
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="UserAgreement.html">
	User Agreement</a>, and take other actions otherwise 
	permitted by law.</p>
	<h3 align="justify">Security </h3>
	<p style="margin-top:0in" align="justify">Your information is stored on our 
	servers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of 
	tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your 
	personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as 
	you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
	transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse 
	your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, 
	although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and 
	you should not expect, that your personal information or private 
	communications will always remain private. </p>
	<h3 align="justify">Third Parties</h3>
	<p style="margin-top:0in" align="justify">Except as otherwise expressly 
	included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and 
	disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your 
	information to others, whether they are purchasers, buyers or sellers on our 
	sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to 
	their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Nellobyte 
	Systems Ltd. does not control the privacy policies of third parties, 
	and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where 
	applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your 
	personal information to others. </p>
	<h3 align="justify">General </h3>
	<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify">We may amend
